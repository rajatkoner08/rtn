# Relation Transformer Network


This repository contains data and code for the papers [Relation Transformer Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.06193) and [Scenes and Surroundings: Scene Graph Generation using Relation Transformer(ICML workshop,2020)
](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.05448). This repository can also be used as a scene graph generator for visual question answering(VQA), please see our work [Graphhopper: Multi-Hop Scene Graph Reasoning for Visual Question Answering
(ISWC,2021)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.06325) for more details. If you like the paper, please cite our work:
